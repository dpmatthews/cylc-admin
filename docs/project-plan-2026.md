# Project Planning: 2026/27

This document attempts to list the main work planned for the next year and to
explore priority topics under consideration beyond that.

## Priorities for the next year

1. Isolated start-up and shut-down graphs (priority for NIWA operations). See
   [cylc-flow#7020](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/issues/7020).

1. Replace suicide triggers with expire triggers. This is already available as
   an experimental feature but needs a little work before it becomes the default.
   See [cylc-flow#7175](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/issues/7175).

1. Address oustanding issues identified during Met Office operational
   implementation (see
   [MO Operator Priorities project](https://github.com/orgs/cylc/projects/6/views/1)).
   In particular:

   * Performance issues with large `cylc set` operations. See
     [cylc-flow#7183](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/issues/7183).
   * Viewing large log files. See
     [cylc-uiserver#421](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-uiserver/issues/421).
   * Multi-select. See [cylc-ui#434](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-ui/issues/434).

1. Support CPU and memory profiling (finishing off work started in 2025). See
   [cylc-flow#6663](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/6663).

1. Support family collapsing in the graph view  (finishing off work started in
   2024). See
   [cylc-ui#1130](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-ui/issues/1130).

1. Port cylc review to Python 3. This is a short term fix to remove a Python 2
   dependency whilst we decide what should replace cylc review longer term. See
   [cylc-uiserver#755](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-uiserver/pull/755).

1. Complete the port of rose edit to Python 3. An initial release is available
   but further work is require to reach the point where we can fully retire the
   Python 2 version.

## Potential future priorities

This section lists the main development areas currently under consideration as
future priorities (without attempting to say what order they should be tackled
or when since this will depend on future resourcing and user feedback).

### Housekeeping

### Polling re-design

### Miscellaneous

Priority developments which needs need to be covered somwhere (not sure where to put them yet):

* Offline data: [cylc-uiserver#378](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-uiserver/issues/378)
* Static graphs: [cylc-ui#82](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-ui/issues/82)
* Source workflows: [cylc-ui#548](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-ui/issues/548)
